Remember the Memory Game you used to play a kid? Where all the cards are flipped over and you turn over 2 cards at a time and try to match up pairs? This is a take on that childhood game using the faces of your family and friends! 

I'm hoping to model this game after the [Hubber Matching Game](https://github.com/alysonla/hubber-memory-game) but using the Facebook API to allow you to pull in your Facebook Friends names & profile pictures.
